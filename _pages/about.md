Dr. Bin Liu joined Newcastle University, Singapore campus, as Assistant Professor in Marine and Offshore Technology since Dec 2022. Before joining Newcastle University, he worked as Research Associate in Imperial College London and Postdoctoral Fellow in Nanyang Technological University. He received Bachelorâ€™s Degree (specialisation in Aeronautical Engineering) and Ph.D Degree from Department of Mechanical Engineering in National University of Singapore in 2015 and 2020, respectively. He has years of experience working on finite element methods, fluid-structure interaction, flow control, hydrodynamics stability and heat & mass transfer.

Over the years, he developed a number of highly robust and efficient finite element codes to simulate large-scale three-dimensional multi-physics problems. He published his research in the prestigious engineering journals, e.g., Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Journal of Computational Physics, Journal of Fluid Mechanics and Physics of Fluids, as the corresponding/first author. He also serves as reviewers in Journal of Fluid Mechanics, Physics of Fluids, Journal of Computational Physics, Journal of Fluid and Structures and Computer & Fluids.

Besides the aforementioned research areas, his current research interests include renewable energy (wind turbine and hydrogen gas turbine), reduced order model and machine learning for fluid dynamics, discontinuous Galerkin methods and turbulence modeling.
